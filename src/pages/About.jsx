           While running TalentQL, we realised that there was a huge knowledge
           gap with some of the software engineers who passed through our
           vetting process, when it came to understanding basic things about

           So, we decided to make things easier by creating a school that is not
           fully a school. An alternative to school. Here you can, in under a
           year, learn and gain a certification in a myriad of disciplines to
           give you a great foundation as well as the start you need to go for
           your dream tech career.
